# TeamPulse

Remote and hybrid teams need fluid, real-time communication and collaboration tools that are scalable and responsive. Traditional platforms like Slack and Trello offer rich features but are heavy, sometimes expensive, and not easily customizable for niche workflows.

TeamPulse is envisioned as a lightweight SaaS platform that enables organizations to run collaborative task boards, message each other, and receive real-time notifications for relevant updates. Built on FastAPI and Socket.IO, it emphasizes low-latency communication, scalable architecture using Redis for pub/sub and caching, and clean multi-tenant separation for security and customizability.
